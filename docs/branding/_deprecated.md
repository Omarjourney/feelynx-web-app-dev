# Deprecated Brand Assets

The following assets were removed or superseded during the v2 neon wordmark rollout:

- `src/assets/feelynx-logo.png` – previously used by `Navbar` and `Navigation` components. Replaced with the `IvibesLogo` React SVG component.
- Legacy favicon/app-icon outputs such as `public/apple-icon-180.png`, `public/apple-splash-*.jpg`, and `public/manifest-icon-*.png` are now generated on demand via `pnpm run generate:brand-icons` and excluded from version control.

Record maintained for archival visibility. Do not reintroduce these assets without brand review.
